JARED: create flash cards for learning the chess coordinate system. one side of the card will have an image of the starting chess board with a square circled, the other side of the card will have the corresponding chess coordinate. ex: h5 There should be 64 cards from white's perspective (white on bottom) and 64 cards from black's perspective (black on bottom).

AGENT: To complete the given objective, a Python script must be written that generates flashcards for learning the chess coordinate system. Each card will have an image of the starting chess board with a highlighted square on one side, and the corresponding chess coordinate on the other side (e.g. h5). A total of 128 cards will be generated, 64 from white's perspective and 64 from black's perspective. To accomplish the sub-task of visualizing the chess board with squares circled, the Python Imaging Library will be utilized.
